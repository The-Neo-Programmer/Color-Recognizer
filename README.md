# Color-Recognizer
A program that provides coordinates for a particular color in the frame and creates a B&W image to show the location of the object.

# Features of this Project:
- The program focuses on a particular color by using a pre-developed color identification algorithm from OpenCV in Python.
- The program first provides the real-time coordinates of the object of the pre-declared color.
- Then it creates a mask layer to differentiate the background from the object(s).

## How to use the Program?
- Please follow the instructions below
- PS: Please ensure that all the files are in the same directory.

# Clone the repository
'''bash

- git clone https://github.com/The-Neo-Programmer/Color-Recogniser.git
- cd Color-Recogniser

# Install the requirements file
- Run the following command in your preferred CMD.
- pip install -r requirements.txt

# Running the program.
- python color-recogniser.py

# How does the program work?
- It will show a continuous stream of output data that it has processed from a connected camera/webcam.
- The pop-up window shows the mask frame and differentiates between the target color space and the non-target color space.
- When a colored object of interest comes inside the frame, a stream of coordinate data is shown.

# Pre-requisites for this Project:
- Basic understanding of Python
- Functioning of libraries
- Basic Error Handling

# Pro-tip!
- If you need help with a complex error, paste your error and the code used to ChatGPT, and I am sure it will solve your doubt for you while providing an explanation and suggestions to fix the error.
- Try it out!!!
